title: Anatomy of a Data Driven Document

Because your D3 code will live within a HTML document, the basic structure tends to follow a traditional pattern:

{% highlight html %}

<html>
  <head>
    <style></style>
    <script src="http://d3js.org/d3.v3.min.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="vis"></div>
    <script></script>
  </body>
</html>

{% endhighlight %}

Although naturally there are many schools of thought on this structure, so being able to pick which bits you need to hack and which bits to leave alone (initially) often takes experimentation.
